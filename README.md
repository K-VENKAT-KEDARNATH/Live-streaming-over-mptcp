# Live-streaming-over-mptcp

***Initial Setup***

The server sends a video, and the client receives it.
To run -> 
run simpleTopo.py. 
On the host h1, run the server code. 
On the host h2, run the client code.

**Improved version**

This setup is similar to the video streaming apps like google meet or zoom, where the server starts and multiple clients connect to it. The server sends a video that is visible to many clients. Clients have their video which they send, and the server can see videos of multiple clients.

To run -> 
run simpleTopo.py
start the server from host h1
clients from other hosts.

The videos are encoded into x264 before sending, compressing the video, reducing the number of packets/data to send.

**Improvement at server PC**

Server PC may run many applications at a time. The current application adds extra stress to that. To reduce that, we have used multi-threading, where three threads perform simultaneously.

thread1->captures video frames.

Main thread->displays captured frames locally.

thread2->sends captured frames.

Doing this gives better performance at server PC, but the requirement of improving at the network layer is still pending...
